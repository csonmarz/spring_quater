Image Import- Image import is when we get pictures from the web or from another persons code and we then import those images and files into our code so it gives us an easy layout without having to do too much. 

for loops- A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list

nested for loops- A nested loop is a loop inside a loop. In this instance, now we have for loops inside other for loops.

module (package/library)- A Python module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes, and variables.

utilization- utilization refers to the time taken by a computer to process some information. In our case, whenever we want to run our code, it kind of takes a long time becasue the code needs to gather all of the information and display it in the output.

function parameter's and arguments-The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function. A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. An argument is the value that are sent to the function when it is called.


lists- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

reusability (using existing code (copy/paste))- This is when we have code already written in the program and for say if we need to use that same code again, we can jus copy and paste it to save us some time

multi-dimensional lists- Multi-dimensional lists are the lists within lists.

file output - File ouput is when you have a file inside the input folder which once you run the code, the output will be displayed into the output folder. For example, when we run the transform.py folder, it gathers all the information and sends it to the output folder which all the changes we put into the input code, will be displayed.
