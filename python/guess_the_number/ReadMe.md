Guess Number:
Function- A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
Function Parameters- A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
Function Arguments- An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.
random module (library)- Python has a built-in module that you can use to make random numbers. The random module has a set of methods (ex randint, random ) 
while loop- A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean
boolean (data Type)- Booleans represent one of two values: True or False( ex if or else)
indentation- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Conditionals (if/else if)- Conditional statements are used to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Abstraction- Abstraction is a technique of hiding unnecessary details from the user

Scope- A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope.

Optimization (need to be able to optimize code)- Code optimization is writing or rewriting code so a program uses the least possible memory
