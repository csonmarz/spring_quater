4 Pillars Of OOP
   1. Abstraction- Abstraction is the concept of oop that only  shows the necesary  attributes and hides the unnecesary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding unnecesary details from the user. 
   
   
   2. Encapsulation - Encapsulation refers to the mechanism of rescricting direct acess to some of our attributes in our program. Resricting the ability to overide the values for your objects within your setters is exaclty the encapsulation priciple is. 



   3. Inheritance- Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to reuse code accros different classes. 




   4. Polymorphism- Polymorphism refers to use of a single type entity to represent different types in different scenarios. Polymorphism is the ability to have different scenarios when we call the same excat entity. An entity can be anything such as a function or a class.
